# Genuary in p5

Going to try and keep up with [genuary](https://genuary.art/) using p5.js. Hopefully I can highlight some lesser known features of p5 and show people how to get more from the webGL renderer.

## Sketches

1. [10,000 particles with custom geometry](https://aferriss.github.io/genuary/1-1/)
2. [Dither drawer](https://aferriss.github.io/genuary/1-2/)
